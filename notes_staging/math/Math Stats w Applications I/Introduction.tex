\section*{Definition}
Statistics is the liason of probability and real-life situations. A statistician will jump between probability methdos and reality with randomness and uncertainty

More specifically, the objective of statistics is to make inferences about a population based on information contained in a sample and provide an associated measure of goodness of the inferences

\section*{Population}
The lrge body of data that we are investigating 
\section*{Sample}
The subset collected from the population
\section*{Parameter Inferences}
To make an inference of hte value of one or more of the relevant parameters, when the population is characterized by numerical descriptive statistics called parameters

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Experiment design to draw the sample
    \item Calculate our inference based on the data generated from the sample
    \item Evaluate the quality of our inference
\end{enumerate}
